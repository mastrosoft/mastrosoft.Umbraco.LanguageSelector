mastrosoft.Umbraco.LanguageSelector
===================================

Language selector for switching to the related page in another language in umbraco...
Register the handler to a chosen url, use it with the ID queryparameter for the current page, and the Culture queryparameter for the language (nl, fr, en,...)
it will then redirect to the chosen language...
Use the module to have it automatically redirect to the previously chosen language if you get in the site trough another site...
